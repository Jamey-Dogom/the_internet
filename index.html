          <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
          <p>Computers connected to the <span class = "b">Web</span> are called <span class = "bld">clients</span> and <span class = "bld">services</span>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class = "b">Clients</span> are the typical Web user's internet-connected devices
                (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone
                 to your mobile network) and <span class = "b">Web-acessing software</span> available on those
                 devices (usually web browser like Firefox or Chrome).
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class = "b">Servers</span> are computers that store <span class = "b">webpages</span>, <span class = "b">site</span>, or <span class = "b">apps</span>.
              When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage
              is downlaoded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed
              in the user's web browser.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>So What Actually Happens?</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>The browser goes to the <span class = "b">DNS server</span> and find the real address of the <span class = "b">server</span> that the website lives on.</li>
            <li>The browser sends and <span class = "b">HTTP request</span> message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.</li>
            <li>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a <span class = "b">"200 OK" message</span>, which means "Permission
                granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks.</li>
            <li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you.</li>
          </ol>
